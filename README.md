## Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and have decided to create a new movie studio. To do so, they want to better understand the movie industry by exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

This book will examine how movies' worldwide gross is impacted by the following parameters:

**Film characteristics:**
-- by genre
-- by release date

**Film personnel:**
-- by talent
-- by director

## Data
Our data come from publicly available online databases about movies, including IMDB, TMBD, and Rotten Tomatoes. These have been combined into a single SQL database.

## Findings 
Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook in this repository for a walkthrough and more explanation of these findings.

* Adventure and Action films far outrank other genres at the box office. 
* On a per-movie basis, Adventure is still among the highest grossing. However, Animation and Sci-Fi are also top performers.
* December-released movies make the most money by far, followed by April and then February. 
* Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Rises, The Dark Night,Inception) tops the list of highest-grossing directors.
